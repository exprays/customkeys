# Nano — Test Guide (Phase 1)

No automated unit tests in Phase 1. Follow these manual steps to verify all features.

---

## Prerequisites

- Backend running locally (`go run ./cmd/server`) or deployed
- Frontend running locally (`npm run dev`) or deployed
- Backend URL noted (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`)
- Frontend open in browser (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)

---

## Test 1: Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

**Expected:**

```json
{ "status": "ok", "service": "nano" }
```

---

## Test 2: Auth — Sign Up

1. Open `http://localhost:3000`
2. You should be redirected to `/login`
3. Click **"Sign up"**

5. Click **Create account**

**Expected:** "Check your email" screen appears (or if email confirmation is disabled in Supabase, you can sign in directly).

If email confirmation is disabled in Supabase:

- Go back to `/login`
- Sign in with your new credentials
- **Expected:** Redirect to `/dashboard`

---

## Test 3: Onboarding — Create Organization

After first login, you should be redirected to `/onboarding`.

2. Click **Create organization**

**Expected:** Redirected to `/dashboard` with org name shown in the header.

If you are NOT redirected to onboarding after login, verify:

Add a second secret:

- Key: `API_KEY`
- Value: `sk_test_abc123`

---

## Test 7: Reveal & Copy a Secret

1. On the secrets list, click the **eye icon** on `DATABASE_URL`
2. The value should appear below the key in green monospace text

**Expected:** `postgres://localhost:5432/mydb` is displayed.

3. Click the **copy icon** on `DATABASE_URL`

**Expected:** Clipboard contains the value (verify by pasting).

---

5. Click **Create token**

**Expected:**

- A green banner appears showing the full token (`nano_XXXX...`)
- Copy the token immediately (it won't be shown again)

Test the token via curl:

```bash
# Replace with your token and environment ID (get eid from the URL when viewing secrets)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer nano_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  http://localhost:8080/v1/envs/YOUR_ENV_ID/secrets/values
```

**Expected:** A JSON object with all secret key-value pairs for that environment.

## Test 16: Backend API Direct Tests

Test the REST API directly with curl (get your JWT from browser devtools → Application → Local Storage → `sb-xxx-auth-token`):

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8080/v1/projects

# Get current org
